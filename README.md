# Web-Design-Challenge

Web Visualization Dashboard

Used jupyter python to import a csv file containing weather data for over 500 cities and converted it into an html table.  Copied and pasted the html table into the data.html page.

Used bootstrap to create a nav bar at the top of every page.  This nav bar changes colors and uses a hamburger list at smaller screen sizes.

Used bootstrap grids to display images and text in sections on the screen.  Adjusted the layout based on screen sizes.
